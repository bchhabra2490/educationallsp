[educationallsp] 2025/10/25 12:04:04 explanation_service.go:24: Explanation:  This line of code takes a message received (msg), decodes it into three parts: a method (like an action or command), content (the data associated with that command), and an error (if something went wrong during decoding). It uses the function DecodeMessage from the rpc package to perform this operation.
